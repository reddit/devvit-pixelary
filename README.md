# Pixelary

Pixelary is a community drawing and guessing game where players compete to earn
points, unlock rewards, and rise up the leaderboard.

## How It Works

**Drawers**

- 10 points for posting a drawing
- 1 point for each correct guess made by others

**Guessers**

- 2 points for each correct guess
- 10 bonus points for being first to guess correctly

## Progression System

Levels follow powers of two, with each level taking progressively longer to
reach. As you level up, unlock exciting perks:

- Extra Drawing Time (+3 seconds per level)
- Exclusive User Flair
- More rewards coming soon!

Track your progress with the progress bar in your community's pinned post.
